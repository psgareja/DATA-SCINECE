Here is a table of the two main types we will spend most of our time working with some examples:

Examples	    Number "Type"
1,2,-5,1000	        Integers
1.2,-0.5,2e2,3E2	Floating-point numbers
now lets start coding.......

Whoa! What just happened? Last time I checked, 7 divided by 4 equals 1.75 not 1!

The reason we get this result is because we are using "floor" division. The // operator (two forward slashes) truncates the decimal without rounding, and returns an integer result.

So what if we just want the remainder after division?

In [6]:
# Modulo
7%4
Out[6]:
3
4 goes into 7 once, with a remainder of 3. The % operator returns the remainder after division.
